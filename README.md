## About The Project

Pong is a classic arcade game that has been enjoyed by millions of people for decades. The objective of the game is simple - two players use their paddles to hit a ball back and forth, trying to score points by making the ball land on the opponent's side of the screen.

I created a version of this classic game using the turtle library in Python. The turtle library allows for the creation of visually appealing graphics and animation, making it the perfect choice for creating a Pong game.

For controls, key 'w' moves player 1 paddle up, key 's' moves player 1 paddle down, key 'Up' moves player 2 paddle up, and key 'Down' moves player 2 paddle down. With these intuitive controls, players can easily maneuver their paddles to keep the ball in play. So whether you're a seasoned pro or a newcomer to the world of Pong, this game is sure to provide hours of fun and excitement.
